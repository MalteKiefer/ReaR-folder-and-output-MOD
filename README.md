# ReaR-folder-and-output-MOD
I missed in the ReaR ( Relax and Recover ) programm/script suite some very useful functions like creation of ISO hybridimages for USB Stick use, USB stickbackup does not contain bootable systems and is not networkshare compatible, ReaR directories are located in /tmp and /var - for very large backups often too small diskspace.
